# challenge-1

## Description

I was asked to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible, functionality that had previously been missing entirely. I added semantic html labels, including header, nav, main, section, aside, and footer. I also added alt attributes on all images, a title for the page, and updated the CSS to match any other changes made.

## Installation

Use git to clone all files and folders to your local drive.

## Usage

Navigate to the relevant directory and open in VS Code or a similar program, and open the index.html file in a browser window. All code is contained in the index.html and style.css files.

## Credits

Thank you to EdX and Northwestern Universtiy for the base code and the opportunity to complete this project.
